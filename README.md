# Amazon_scraper-
This is a Python web scraper that extracts data from Amazon.in based on a user-defined search term, including product name, description, URL, price, rating, reviews, and manufacturer information. It uses requests to get HTML, BeautifulSoup to parse it, and msedge.selenium_tools to navigate the web pages and save the data to a CSV file.
