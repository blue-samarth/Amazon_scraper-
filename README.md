# Amazon_scraper-
This is a Python web scraper that extracts data from Amazon.in based on a user-defined search term, including product name, description, URL, price, rating, reviews, and manufacturer information. It uses requests to get HTML, BeautifulSoup to parse it, and msedge.selenium_tools to navigate the web pages and save the data to a CSV file.
The first step is to import the required libraries, which are requests, BeautifulSoup, pandas, and msedge.selenium_tools. We use the requests library to get the HTML content of the web page. BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content and traverse the HTML tree to extract the required information. pandas is used to create a DataFrame that will store the extracted data. msedge.selenium_tools is used to open the web browser and navigate to the web pages.
The user is prompted to enter a search term. This search term will be used to search for products on Amazon.in. The search term can be anything from a product name to a keyword.
The search URL is generated using the search term entered by the user. The search URL is the URL of the search results page that is generated when the search term is entered into the search bar on Amazon.in.
The scraper will use the generated search URL to access the search results page on Amazon.in. It will then use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content of the page and extract the required information such as the product name, description, URL, price, rating, number of reviews, product description, and manufacturer information. The scraper will navigate through multiple pages of search results to extract all the data.Once the relevant data is located, the scraper extracts the information using Python programming techniques.The extracted data is then cleaned and processed to ensure that it is in a usable format. This includes removing unwanted characters, formatting numbers and currency, and converting data types.
The extracted data will be saved to a CSV file using pandas. The CSV file will be saved in the same directory as the Python script.
This is the breif overview of what this piece of code does


The project is useful for several reasons. Firstly, it saves a lot of time and effort for anyone who needs to extract data from Amazon.in. Manually collecting such information can be a tedious and time-consuming process. With this web scraper, the process is automated, and the data is quickly and efficiently extracted and organized.
Secondly, the extracted data can be used for a variety of purposes, such as market research, price tracking, competitor analysis, and more. For example, a business owner can use the data to monitor the pricing of products in their niche, while a researcher can use it to study consumer behavior and preferences.
Finally, the project can be customized and adapted to suit individual needs. Users can define their own search terms and criteria, enabling them to extract data that is most relevant to their specific requirements. This flexibility makes the project an invaluable tool for businesses, researchers, and anyone else who needs to extract data from Amazon.in.
